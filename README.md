<h2>Launching Instructions</h1> 

To run and deploy the code in this repository, follow these detailed instructions:

---

### **1. Clone the Repository**
Ensure that Git is installed on your system. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ReemB4/GP2_code.git
cd GP2_code
```

---

### **2. Set Up the Environment**

#### **Using Python Virtual Environment**
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **On Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **On macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

### **3. Prepare the Application**

#### **Configuration**
- Ensure the necessary datasets (e.g., protein and peptide data) are available in the appropriate directory or paths specified in the code.
- If the application uses `.env` for environment variables, create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure it with the required settings (e.g., API keys, database connections, or application secrets).

---

### **4. Run the application Locally**

#### **Flask Application**
1. Start the Flask development server:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
2. If a specific script (e.g., `create_database.py`,` app.py`) needs to be executed:
   ```bash
   python create_database.py
   python app.py
   ```

#### **Access the Application**
- Open your browser and navigate to:
  ```
  http://127.0.0.1:5000
  ```

### **Troubleshooting**
- Verify Python version compatibility (as specified in `requirements.txt`).
- Check for missing dependencies or library versions and update if necessary.
- Ensure your system meets the hardware/software requirements for the application.

### GP2 code Features

The GP2 Code application provides tools for analyzing Parkinson’s disease progression, including:
- Protein and Peptide Insights: Fetches detailed data from the UniProt API.
- Patient History: Tracks patient visits and progression over time.
- Comparisons: Compares data across patient visits and between patients.
- Clustering: Groups patients into meaningful subpopulations using clustering techniques.
- Regression Analysis: Predicts UPDRS scores with advanced machine learning models like XGBoost.
